**Topic Title: Dermatology Essentials and Product Ingredient Analyzer Bot**

The Dermatology Essentials and Product Ingredient Analyzer Bot is a tool designed for individuals to help them in developing smart choices about cosmetic essentials and skincare decisions. With the increase of beauty influencers, finding the right products for our skin can be demanding. This proposed bot is designed to analyze the cosmetic product ingredients in terms of what benefits are associated with those ingredients and what side effects or allergic reactions they can cause. It also identifies users’ skin types and suggests appropriate ingredients and products based on their skin conditions, allergies, and spending limits. 


Objectives: 

(1) To analyze cosmetic ingredients and explain their benefits, possible irritants, and allergens. (2) To identify and warn users of common allergens in products to avoid any allergic reactions. (3) To determine users’ skin types and recommend proper ingredients based on their skin needs and sensitivities. (4) To guide users in effective skincare routines with compatible product layering.

Nature of Data
The nature of data for the bot consists of qualitative data, which allows for organized analysis, such as text descriptions of product ingredients, their benefits, potential irritants, and product recommendations; categorical data like skin types, ingredient categories (e.g., oils, acids), and product types (e.g., moisturizers, serums). It also includes quantitative data, such as prices, and ingredient concentrations.

Data Sources
We collected approved skin care products and other related data from FDA website with entries that are timely, significant and complete. To keep things relevant, we selected key fields like product ID, name, type, main ingredients, their benefits, suitability, directions for use, skin concerns, allergens to avoid, pricing, and whether the products are alcohol-free, cruelty-free, or fragrance-free. This way, our dataset stays relevant and meaningful for the analysis.

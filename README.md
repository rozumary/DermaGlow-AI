Nature of Data
The nature of data for the bot consists of qualitative data, which allows for organized analysis, such as text descriptions of product ingredients, their benefits, potential irritants, and product recommendations; categorical data like skin types, ingredient categories (e.g., oils, acids), and product types (e.g., moisturizers, serums). It also includes quantitative data, such as prices, and ingredient concentrations.

Data Sources
We collected approved skin care products and other related data from FDA website with entries that are timely, significant and complete. To keep things relevant, we selected key fields like product ID, name, type, main ingredients, their benefits, suitability, directions for use, skin concerns, allergens to avoid, pricing, and whether the products are alcohol-free, cruelty-free, or fragrance-free. This way, our dataset stays relevant and meaningful for the analysis.
